# MyBME280

Lightweight Arduino library.
Supports temperature (Â°C), humidity (%RH), pressure (hPa), and altitude (m) readings via IÂ²C.

---

## Features

- Read **temperature**, **humidity**, and **pressure**
- Calculate **altitude** (based on sea-level pressure)
- Supports **IÂ²C** (default address `0x76`)
- Simple, minimal, and educational
- Designed for **embedded projects** and **students**
